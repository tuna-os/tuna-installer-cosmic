# TunaOS COSMIC Installer — Roadmap

**Last updated**: 2026-08-24 | **Maintainer**: tuna-os (hanthor)

## Mission

Ship the COSMIC desktop's install experience: a real `cosmic::Application`
frontend that gathers the user's choices, writes the fisherman recipe, and
presents the backend's progress and result — so a first-time COSMIC user gets
a native, polished install from first boot to desktop.

---

## Current Status

- **App**: libcosmic (Iced/Rust) frontend for the fisherman bootc backend —
  six screens (welcome, disk selection, options, confirmation, install
  progress, completion), CI-rendered walkthrough in docs/screenshots.
- **Distribution**: image-baked flatpak (`org.tunaos.InstallerCosmic`) — no
  standalone GitHub Releases (by design, not yet documented as policy).
- **Parity**: covered by `installer-smoke.yml` + `docs/INSTALLER-FRONTENDS.md`
  checks (readiness stamp, non-blank, advances, per-screen OCR).
- **Health**: active (pushed 08-24); open issues concentrate on install-recipe
  hardening (#39/#40/#41) and backend privilege boundary (#38).

### Priorities

| Priority | Item | Tracking | Status |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| P0 | Install-recipe hardening — unpredictable recipe path, 0600 mode honored | #39/#41 | 🟡 Open |
| P0 | Unpin `cargo-sources` generation (flatpak-cargo-generator.py) | #40 | 🟡 Open |
| P1 | Privileged install backend — only unpinned binary in the image | #38 | 🟡 Open |
| P1 | Parity reporting — only frontend that emits no parity signal | #36 | 🟡 Open |
| P2 | ROADMAP-coverage entry in org ROADMAP tally | #1295 | ⬜ Not started |
